# pyroscope-python

Pyroscope continuous profiling agent for Python applications.

Uses [py-spy](https://github.com/benfred/py-spy) for stack sampling and the [pyroscope](https://crates.io/crates/pyroscope) Rust crate to send profiles to a Pyroscope server.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pyroscope-io
```

For source builds, initialize the native dependency submodules with
`git submodule update --init --recursive`. Cargo uses the `py-spy` submodule
as a local path dependency; its version is pinned by the parent repository.
